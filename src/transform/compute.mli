(** [compute_in_goal defs branches env] returns the transformation

    the definition of symbols. When [branches] is true,
    also computes under branches of if and match.  *)

(** [compute_in_hypothesis n defs branches p env] returns the transformation
    that computes in hypothesis [p]. When [n] is some integer [i],
    performs at most [i] steps. *)

(** [simplify filter env] returns the transformation that computes in
